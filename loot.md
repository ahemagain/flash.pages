# <Flash> DKP

## System

We are using the Monolith DKP Addon for DKP. It is not essential for everyone to have this Addon installed, but it is recommended. With the Addon you can easily track yours and others DKP as well as easily bid during raids.
## How it works:
With the addon: Type /dkp to open the UI. With this you can see yours and your guild mates dkp. During raids, the master looter will initiatie bidding and a few options will appear in a pop up window. Place Bid or Pass are the ones you will only really use. If you want the item, click Place Bid and you should see a message in your chat window saying Bid request accepted. Once the timer runs out, the person who bid with the highest dkp will win the item, if there is a tie then /roll determines the winner.
## Without the addon: 
Without the addon installed, the same applies as above but without the benefits of a pop up window. If an item drops that you are interested in, simply type !bid and you will be in the running for the item.
## Fixed Cost
We have opted for a ‘Fixed Cost’ method of DKP. This means that each item that drops will cost a set amount of DKP. The more desirable the item, the higher the DKP cost.
## Spending DKP
Whoever wins an item will have the cost of the item deducted from their DKP total. If the cost of an item will bring your DKP total below 0, you will enter negative DKP. We will prioritise MS over OS, and OS rolls will be half price.
## Earning DKP
Players will earn DKP for the following: Raid Start: 5 dkp Boss Kill: 5 dkp Raid End: 5 dkp
So, a full MC clear will earn a player 60 dkp
## Decay
We have currently decided on a 25% Weekly Decay rate. If you end the week on 150 DKP. The following week you will instead be on 112 DKP. If the percentage brings your dkp number to a 0.5 such as 112.5, we will round down to 112.
## Phases
When a new raid tier releases, all DKP will be reset and DKP will be dropped from outdated raid tiers.
For example, When AQ is released, everyone’s DKP will be 0 and we will no longer use DKP in Ony/MC. Instead we will use /roll in the old raid tiers.
## Disclaimer
As this system is new to us, we will be refining things as we go. If we notice some things seem unbalanced or need alterations then we will make them as and when it is needed. Ofcourse, when any changes are made, the guild will be notified of what will be changed and why.
