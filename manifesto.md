# <Flash> Manifesto

We’ve been having a great discussion to pull together what we’ve set out below. Thank you all for your contribution, amazing to hear so many people passionate about <Flash> and their Classic experience. Please read what we’ve set out below, take some time to think about it. Chat in general, in game and most importantly with your guildmates!

Put a like against this post if this is something you are happy to sign up to and come along to the MC raid on Saturday.

## <Flash> Ethos
Community, first and foremost. This is the main thing we want to capture within <Flash>. We want a space where like minded people can come and hang out and feel welcome. The focus will be end game content and raiding specifically, creating a strong community of players who wish to progress through raids together. What we won't do is expect people to be at every raid, we understand life gets in the way, we're all adults now with real jobs (except Fork) and can't play as much as we'd like.

Below is a more specific breakdown of how we see the guild running.

Guild Structure
There has been a lack of clarity regarding the structure of <Flash> with people not really knowing who the officers are.

With the recent guild change it was voted by our current officers that Obskur will be taking the helm and has been promoted to Guild Leader. 

Below is a list of our current officers.

- Chaptastix
- Forknife
- Lashina
- Loogiechiken
- Omag
- Orrio
- Shrike
- Sktai

The aim is to move away from “officers” and towards having class advisors and raid personnel. All of these people will have the same abilities and can do any role when needed.

## Raid Times
Raid times are a big factor for most people. The schedule will remain unchanged - Saturday 21:00 server time. When we are re-established and ready for BWL we will aim to raid Ony/MC on a Wednesday and BWL on Saturday. 

## Attitudes To Raiding
### Fun
Maybe the most cliche thing ever but the most important thing we want in raiding is to have fun, otherwise what's the point in playing? We don't want to be super serious, people die? Point and laugh. We can have a laugh in raids whilst still remaining focused.
### No min/max
We won't be enforcing the most optimal talents, items etc.. we're here for fun, not to be competitive.
Sub-optimal specs welcome (within reason)
All specs are welcome. However, we would consider limiting the raid spaces for these specs if it prevents progression. We would potentially request people to respec for the benefit of the guild and by doing so would do what we can to provide that player with the necessary gear they need.


### Flasks/consumables not expected
We aren't going to be expecting players to drop 100g+ on flasks, the cheap back alley dish water in a vial is just fine. There will be some encounters where certain, cheap, consumables are very valuable… e.g. Ragnaros. Looking for you to take as much responsibility as you can to support the guild in the best way. 
Boss debuff slots to be considered
Organising debuff slots is something we will be looking into. Prioritising this should help increase our run times and make kills cleaner.
Aim for progression and improvement
While raiding, we want to go in with the mindset of clearing the content and seeing everything classic has to offer. If we hit a wall, we want to also strive to improve ourselves, looking at our rotations and gear, whatever can give us an extra edge.

## Sign-up
Raid sign ups will remain mostly the same but with a little more structure and ease of use. 

Sign ups will happen at the start of the week, with a cut off on Wednesday and will be finalised and announced on Thursday. This leaves plenty of time for those who couldn’t get a slot to make other plans or PUG etc. 

## Loot
We will be using a DKP system from Saturday 8th February. We want a transparent, easy to follow system that doesn’t slow down the raid and rewards attendance. So, how does this dkp system differ from the previous one? Well…

Items will be assigned a DKP value e.g - main hand weapons 50 DKP, 2h weapon 100 DKP, bracers 30 DKP and so on. Players will gain DKP for raid start/end and boss kills, and all players will start with 50 DKP. When items are announced, everyone who wants the item will declare their interest “123”, and must have enough DKP to cover the set DKP value of the item. Player with the highest DKP total wins and the set value is deducted from their total immediately. In the event of a tie players can opt-in to a /roll. Winner has the set value deducted from their total immediately. Off-spec items will be half price. Main spec is always priority over offspec.

That is the general idea, however, we are still deciding how to do certain things with the DKP in order to keep it relevant and fair. We will aim to flesh this out and explain in greater detail later on.


Thank you for taking the time to read through this and we hope it’s something you can get on board with.

Kisses, xxx
